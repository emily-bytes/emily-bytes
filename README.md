<<<<<<< HEAD
- Hello everyone, I'm Emily (she/her) and I was raised internationally in Korea, Japan, Germany, and the US. However, I consider Seattle my home since I've lived here the longest. After serving in the military as a Behavioral Health Consultant and Therapist, I decided to move back to Washington and change careers. Within the past year, I have successfully completed Programming Boot camp and earned a Certificate in Computer Science Fundamentals at Seattle University. I am currently enrolled in the Ops and Cybersecurity program at Code Fellows and start the Master of Computer Science Program at SU in the fall. I am a life-long student and won't miss out on an opportunity to   expand my knowledge!
