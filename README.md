>## **About Me** 
- Hi, I'm Emily (she/her) and I was raised internationally in Korea, Japan, Germany, and the US. However, I consider Seattle my home since I've lived here the longest. After serving in the military as a Behavioral Health Consultant and Therapist, I decided to move back to Washington and change careers. Within the past two years, I have successfully completed Programming Boot Camp and earned a Certificate in Computer Science Fundamentals at Seattle University. I had some exposure with operations and networking with Code Fellows during the summer and am now enrolled in the Master of Science in Computer Science Program at SU, with an expected graduation of Spring 2024. I am a life-long student and won't miss out on an opportunity to expand my knowledge!
